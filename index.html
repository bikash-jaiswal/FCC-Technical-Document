                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.
                    What you should already know
                    This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

                    A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                    Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
                    Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main page about JavaScript.
                    JavaScript and Java
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.

                    Hello world
                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");
                    Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
                    Variables
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.
